# Wayback Proxy - Caching Proxy for the Wayback Machine

Found [another proxy project](https://github.com/richardg867/WaybackProxy) that mostly did what I wanted, but it would constantly ping the wayback servers with no rate limit or cache, so I was constantly being rate limited when using it.

So I remade the idea from scratch with some other addtions that I wanted.
